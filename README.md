[BME280 breakout(101414)][board]

## Description and details
BME280 is an atmospheric sensor which measures 3 things: temperature, pressure, and humidity + it is possible to calculate elevation. It is simple to use since it communicates via I2C and it is extra small sized so it can be put just anywhere. Everything you need to know about the atmospheric condition - this sensor can measure for you; just ideal for meteo station projects!
